# AIWinpetition_Team2_icantfindaname.py

we created a variable and a countdown timer

we also created a score counter stating each player's score at the end.

we selected a few themes and related starter sentences and "grouped" them accordingly.

a theme and starter sentence will be randomly selected for each game.

players have to input the number of players and their names and the number of players cannot be less than 2 else an error message will show.

an instruction will be given including a welcome message and the amount of time they have to play. 

after a player presses "Enter", the timer will begin and each player has to input a word and after all of them have finished inputting, the AI will continue with the story and respond and the same thing happens over and over again.

after the time is up, it will finalise and type out the final story.

the individual score of each player, whole group's score and winner will also be printed out. if it is a tie-breaker, it will show "Draw!".

thats it!
